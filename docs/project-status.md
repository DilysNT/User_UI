# Project Status Summary

## 🎯 Frontend Development: COMPLETED ✅

### Main Features
- ✅ Tour booking flow (authenticated + guest users)
- ✅ Payment integration with multiple gateways
- ✅ Booking confirmation with QR codes
- ✅ Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Error handling and fallback data
- ✅ Auto-detection approach for user types

### Key Components
- `components/details/Booking.tsx` - Main booking form
- `components/details/Payment.tsx` - Payment processing
- `components/details/Confirmation.tsx` - Success page
- `app/payment-success/page.tsx` - Payment success route

### Technical Implementation
- **Guest Bookings**: No `user_id` in payload, no Authorization header
- **Auth Bookings**: Include `user_id`, has Authorization header
- **API Auto-Detection**: Backend should detect user type from headers

## ⏳ Pending Backend Work

### Required Backend Changes
1. **Auto-Detection Logic** in `POST /api/bookings`
   - Detect guest vs authenticated users
   - Auto-create guest users when needed
   - Handle bookings without `user_id` field

2. **Guest User Management**
   - Create guest user records automatically
   - Link guest bookings to guest users

### Backend Status
❌ **Still expecting `user_id` field in all requests**  
❌ **Throws "user_id cannot be null" error for guest bookings**

## 🧪 Testing

### Available Tests
- `tests/guest-booking-test.js` - Test booking API endpoints
- `tests/payment-success-test.html` - Test confirmation page

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test guest booking API
node tests/guest-booking-test.js

# Test payment success page
# Open tests/payment-success-test.html in browser
```

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Backend Team**: Implement auto-detection logic per `docs/backend-requirements.md`
2. **Frontend Team**: Wait for backend, then test end-to-end flow
3. **QA Team**: Test complete booking workflow once backend is ready

## 📞 Contact
Frontend is complete and ready for backend integration.  
All guest booking logic is implemented and waiting for backend auto-detection.
